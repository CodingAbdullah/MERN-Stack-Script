Automating the process of setting up your full-stack development environment. No need to pull the repo, a ready-made can be created once you pull this script.

A couple things you need to know:

The format to follow is the following on your command-line (this script is LINUX-COMPLIANT ONLY):

sh create-react-app.sh <YOUR-LAPTOP-NAME>

You need to provide the laptop name to make this work. 

When the script proceeds to the step of validating the package.json file for the back-end folder, either enter the required information or simply press enter to all incoming options to complete. 

Note this script will create the development folder on the Desktop by default.
